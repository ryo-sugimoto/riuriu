Most of solution that exist in the internet is tell you to create a task and call it using ctrl-shift-p menu.

This extension basically using [htmlbeautifier](https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier) to format your file using the Formatter API from the vscode, so no need to create a hack using Task, etc.

## Requirements
